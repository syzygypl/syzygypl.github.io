An insight into your own company or team to evaluate your weak points is one of the greatest tools you can use to improve. We try to do it constantly using various ways (sprint retrospectives for example), but I’d like to think critical thinking about onesevles run in our blood. This is why we recently indentified a potential problem in the way we aproach to projects.

It became apparent to us, that the roles we take in each project are unclear. There is a huge gray area, especially between team leaders, senior developers and project managers. We haven’t talked about it much so obviously there are some expectations that are not met on both sides.

To challenge this we made a list of all project roles we feel are required, and we did this in two separate teams to combine different points of view. This list was strongly focused on team leader responsibilities first, but it became clear that it’s one sided, and we cannot just dump all this responsibilities on one person, and that it varies from project to project.

## Project roles

What we did instead is a general list of roles, and for now it goes as follows (in random order):

### Helicopter view

Basically knowing more that is required to do your tasks, both in and out of your department. This allows you to connect the dots and make decisions based on the project as a whole. You can’t coordinate tasks and teamwork without a helicopter view. For example, knowing the design progress so you can anticipate and plan accordingly. Or even more trivial example, knowing when one departament will finish their job, so another can start. Or to know when one person can help out another, because they’ve done something similar or their tasks are related somehow.

### Responding to ad-hoc situations

If project is on fire, you’re the first line of defence. You may (and probably need to) delegate it further, but you’re the rapid response team. This allows an easy way out for every team member if something goes wrong and an urgent fix is required, for example the project needs an additional developer, because the project is behind schedule. Without this role, the responsibility would be distributed among the whole team and as such it would be ineffective.

### Reporting

You can present project status to stakeholders and bring anyone up to date. This may relate only to certain fields of the project, such as development, design or other.

### Documenting

Updating knowledge on Confluence, so everyone is on the same page. Documenting has a broader meaning, but for the purpose of defining roles, let’s just stick to gathering all knowledge and arrangements in one place. This may be as trivial as meeting notes — someone has to do it. Without this role, there wouldn’t be a single source of truth about the project; all would be scattered between JIRA tasks, emails, bug trackers, slack, etc.

### Risk Management

This is both bringing awareness of project risks to the team, as well as acting on the current identified risks. For example, if we have a tight schedule, we need to pay extra attention to our estimates, and regular plannings should reflect that, and the team need to be aware of the priorities — no needless refactors this time, sorry. 

### Project Management

Managing everything related to JIRA and short term planning — daily standups, weekly or bi-weekly plannings, assigning tasks if that rocks your boat, putting down estimations, looking at burndowns if you have them.

### Traffic / Role delegation

Helping in deciding which team member is best for the task at hand. Assigning roles mentioned here is also a traffic job, so I guess this role needs to be assigned first. 

### Planning / Task estimation

Self explanatory. In contrast to project management, this is about giving the estimates during planning using your best knowledge and expertise. This also means estimating larger chunks of projects basing on your experience, not the actual detailed specs. This can guide high-level decisions as to what direction to choose, which parts of the project are unprofitable, etc.

### Announcing goals

Communicating to the team what is the most important at a given point in time. In general this can be understood as providing a transparent communication to the team.

### Expectation Management

This is similar to risk management. We know our shortcomings, or we know where the (client’s) disappointments usually come from, so we try to get ahead of them and warn people ahead of time. For example if the team is inexperienced in a given technology we should announce that and explain what would it mean for the project, so nobody is surprised later. There is no better thing than a fuckup you know about in advance!

### Ownership

Being responsible for the whole project, delegating each role to the team. This is the topmost role, and arguably most important one. If anything doesn’t go as planned, this person is responsible in the end.

### Architecture

Designing high level solutions, especially in the early project stages. This is a strictly technical role, and as such should be assigned to one of the senior developers. The architect needs to be included in the project as early as possible, so they can have their input in the discovery phase.

### Consulting

Giving a helping hand in your area of expertise when needed. For example by attending a meeting or doing a code review, but not being otherwise involved in the project. 

### Scaling

Looking at multiple projects at a time and seeing them as one. Reuse, transferring knowledge between them, etc. This does not benefit the project directly, but allows you to grow as a company — cut costs, provide a better product and do it all faster.


## Next steps

After we created the above list, we had last question to answer: what did we create? How will it help us in the future? Will we just stick a „this things need to be done” label on it and get on with our lives? Or will this become a part of job description for new employees, so we can blissfully and naively give ourselves high five for a job well done?

The main takeaway for us is that we now have some kind of baseline we can work with. Our next step is to define who has each of those roles in one of the projects by creating a [responsibility assignment matrix](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Responsibility_assignment_matrix), and go from there. Maybe this list isn’t complete? Maybe it’s too broad? Assigning those roles may cause some surprises or heated discussions. We may end up not assigning all of them if we feel none of us can do it correctly or just doesn’t have the time?

Whatever comes from it, we all have a strong feeling we will learn something about our culture and project management, and that it’s a solid cornerstone for further improvement.
