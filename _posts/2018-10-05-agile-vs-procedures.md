[Last time](/project-roles) I described the process we went through from discovering a problem to creating a solution — [the responsibility matrix](/project-roles). The whole time I had a feeling that we’re not following the agile spirit. It advocates **people and interaction** over **processes and tools**, so a written rule about the roles and responsibilities don’t fit this image.

On the other hand, we really see the benefit it brings us. So what’s the true takeaway from this? Should we not be agile every time? Is the manifesto wrong? Do we understand it incorrectly? Why is there a conflict between the Agile Manifesto and the solution that works for us? Or is there a way to have the cake and eat it too — to both follow agile practices and use all this work we did by specifying the responsibility matrix?

I think there is, and it’s a simple one too. We just can’t use the matrix as a procedure, but rather as a guideline. The point is to give us more information about the team and how will everyone contribute, but no one forces us to follow it strictly. This requires clear communication above all so we won’t give the impression that we have created a procedure we need to follow to the letter. 

As long as this is only a tool that helps us to interact and understand each other better, we feel it’s fine to adapt it. The devil is in the details as usual: it’s interactions _over_ — not _instead of_ — procedures. That’s a great rule of thumb for each discovery we’re considering in our daily work: **as long as it’s only a framework secondary to individual interactions, then it’s not constraining us and it’s safe to use it**.
