We are Syzygy, a Digital Production Agency.

![](https://media.szg.io/uploads/media/5720827a4fff3/about-04.jpg)

We strive to create great working conditions for developers despite uncertain future, 
rough deadlines and vague client needs.  These are the things that may distinguish us
from other companies:

 * We are not a corporation. We are not a startup either, but we are often compared to one  
 * We work for our clients. This means less flexibility on one hand, but more challenges on the other  
 * Our projects are ranging from small (a few weeks, local clients) to large (over a year
 for international clients)  
 * Agile practices are applied whenever possible, but we’re not very strict about it  
 * High code quality is one of our key values and we go to great lengths to achieve it  

There are a lot of perks to working with us, but this ad is to narrow to list all of them.
Yes, there is a game console. No, there is no dress code. Yes, you can have flexible working 
hours, medical benefits and other free stuff. You get the idea. To have a better understanding
of our culture visit [our values page](/values), or look at our [github](https://github.com/syzygypl).

Or better yet just contact us if this feels something you might be interested in and we can answer 
all your questions in person. 

Looking forward to hearing from you!
